## Emergency Room Queue Management 

ER Queue Management is a Java desktop application that has a graphical user interface
that triages the patients in the Emergency Room. In Metro Vancouver, we often face unexpectedly long waits in the Emergency Room.
To minimize the wait time and the workforce prioritizing patients, this application prioritizes and outputs the estimated wait time and patient queue.

It lets the user (triage nurse) to enter information about the patient (Name, Age, Level of Severity, Time of Arrival, Temperature, Pulse, Blood Pressure).
Possible features include estimated wait time; order in queue; emergency updates (symptoms, X-ray results, lab results); Nurse/Doctor's treatment start time.

The triage nurse will enter and update the information.
The patients and guardians waiting in the Emergency Room can see the outputs on the screen.
Also, the patients searching for an Emergency Room can see the estimated wait time on a website.
